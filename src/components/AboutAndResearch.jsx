          <h2>Leading UX Research & Innovation</h2>
          <p>
            With over 10 years of experience in UX research, design, and testing, I specialize in Mixed Method Research,
            blending qualitative and quantitative approaches with Machine Learning integration. My expertise spans heuristic
            analysis, eye tracking, behavioral studies, cognitive psychology, and applied statistics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently leading a team of researchers at Angel One working on a Stock Broking Application, I build tailored
            research frameworks to drive business and user-focused insights. I'm skilled in design research methodologies,
            usability testing, surveys, clustering, benchmarking, and UX metrics with a strong focus on accessibility and
            research operations (ResearchOps).
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond UX research, I have a background in documentary filmmaking and visual storytelling. My creative practice
            has directly enriched my ethnographic and qualitative research skills, enhancing my ability to observe, interpret,
            and represent user behavior with depth and empathy.
          </p>
