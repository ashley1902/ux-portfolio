          <p className="cs3-content-text">
            This project started with a feeling, not a feature.
          </p>
          <p className="cs3-content-text">
            Users were opening the OTT aggregator app, scrolling for a while, and closing it ‚Äî without watching anything. The metric sheets showed engagement drop-offs. The product team had a simple hypothesis: if people could find something to watch in under a minute, they'd stay.
          </p>
          <p className="cs3-content-text">
            But as I delved into interviews and looked deeper into logs and survey results, the story became more complex ‚Äî and more human.

          </div>

          <p className="cs3-content-text">
            Indu from Ahmedabad said she watches shows while preparing dinner. But if the show is unfamiliar or the title sounds strange, she simply replays old favorites.

          <p className="cs3-quote">"I don't want to waste time. I want something I know I'll like."</p>

          <p className="cs3-content-text">
            This wasn't just a problem of design. This was a problem of decision-making confidence. We needed to reduce emotional friction, not just UI friction.

          <h2 className="cs3-section-title">Context & Initial Signals</h2>
          <p className="cs3-content-text">
            The app targeted Indian users across metros, tier-2 cities, and towns, offering curated access to streaming content. We began with an exploratory field study across:
          </p>
          <ul className="cs3-content-list">
            <li>Delhi</li>
            <li>Mumbai</li>
            <li>Bangalore</li>
            <li>Ahmedabad</li>
          </ul>

          <img src="/user-types.png" alt="What kind of people" className="cs3-image" />

          <p className="cs3-content-text">
            Users consumed content on phones, shared smart TVs, and second-hand tablets. Many used the app post-10 PM, after work or dinner, often while multitasking. Despite a sleek interface, something wasn't working.

        <div className="cs3-content-section">
          <h2 className="cs3-section-title">Session Drop-Off: The Silent Failure</h2>
          <p className="cs3-content-text">
            The first major clue came from usage analytics.

          </ul>

          <p className="cs3-content-text">
            This was not immediate churn. It was slow erosion ‚Äî a sign of cognitive fatigue or loss of trust. This became a north star metric: if we could fix retention beyond Session 6, we were winning.

          <h2 className="cs3-section-title">Quantitative Insights: A Survey Within a Study</h2>
          <p className="cs3-content-text">
            To complement our ethnographic findings, we designed and distributed a structured survey to Frenzi users. The goal was to validate behavioral patterns, understand decision dynamics at scale, and explore trust, personalization, and friction points.
          </p>
          <p className="cs3-content-text">
            We offered 2000 Frenzi points as an incentive ‚Äî and it worked. Over 400 users initiated the survey, and after careful cleaning and validation across 7 data sheets, we retained 271 serious responses. These respondents weren't just hunting for points; their sessions aligned with meaningful engagement patterns.
          </p>
          <p className="cs3-content-text">
            We explored over 120 variables: trust in recommendations, favorite genres, session durations, platform preferences, watchlist behavior, decision confidence, and more.
          </p>

          <div className="cs3-quote-section">
            <p className="cs3-quote">"If my friend says it's good, I'll watch. Not if the app does."</p>
            <p className="cs3-quote">"I save shows... but never go back to them."</p>
            <p className="cs3-quote">"There's too much clutter ‚Äî too many sliders, too many choices."</p>
          </div>

          <p className="cs3-content-text">
            These echoed what we heard qualitatively ‚Äî but now, we could see their shape in the data.
          </p>

          <h3>Our Process</h3>
          <p className="cs3-content-text">We started by:</p>
          <ul className="cs3-content-list">
            <li>Cleaning and merging 7 sheets of data into a structured dataset.</li>
            <li>Filtering incomplete and "point-only" respondents by cross-checking open text answers, session logs, and behavioral inconsistencies.</li>
            <li>Visualizing genre preferences, platform usage, watchlist adoption, and trust behaviors.</li>
            <li>Identifying correlations and user clusters based on key decision triggers.</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="cs3-content-text">We filtered out these drop-offs by checking:</p>
          <ul className="cs3-content-list">
            <li>Post-survey login patterns</li>
            <li>Absence of watchlist adds</li>
            <li>Engagement - sessions</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Key Insights</h3>
          
          <h4>Trust and Social Influence</h4>
          <p className="cs3-content-text">
            When asked if they trusted the app's recommendations, a majority expressed hesitation. But those who marked "Yes" or "Sometimes" tended to watch more and reported higher satisfaction.
          </p>

          <h4>Watchlist as a Proxy for Intent</h4>
          <p className="cs3-content-text">
            Users who actively used the Watchlist feature were 2.3x more likely to return to the app within 48 hours. Interestingly, many still didn't trust it to surface content at the right time.
          </p>

          <h4>Platform and Genre Preferences</h4>
          <p className="cs3-content-text">
            Mobile usage dominated. Comedy, Horror, and action topped the genre charts. Users with strong genre preferences were less likely to feel overwhelmed, suggesting familiarity reduces friction.
          </p>

          <h4>Decision-Making is Social</h4>
          <p className="cs3-content-text">
            A standout stat: Nearly 50% said their decision to watch was influenced more by friends or family than app recommendations or trailers.
          </p>

          <h4>Frenzi Point False Positives</h4>
          <p className="cs3-content-text">
            During synthesis, we noticed a strange skew: high engagement followed by abrupt drop-offs ‚Äî but after triangulating with behavior logs, we found a major false positive. Digging deeper, we realized many users came only for the 2000-point incentive. We filtered these out ‚Äî but it was a humbling reminder that not all data is real data.

            This was not just a research project ‚Äî it was an emotional audit of decision-making.

            The false positives in the survey taught me to validate behavior, not just ask opinions. Thematic coding helped surface hesitation not as a usability issue, but a trust and confidence issue. The neuroscience experiment revealed subtle signs of mental fatigue. The quant side triangulated everything ‚Äî from watchlist as a retention predictor to genre loyalty shaping behavior.

            Had I not approached this with an ethnographer's eye and a behavioral scientist's rigor, we might have just tweaked banners and colors ‚Äî instead, we redesigned for decision certainty.

            While our behavioral and survey data painted a compelling picture of user hesitation, I kept wondering‚Äîwhat if we could go one step deeper? What if we could track not just what users clicked or said, but how they felt‚Äîmoment to moment‚Äîwhen using the app?

            I revisited a tool I had experimented with in a previous project: NeuroSky EEG headbands, a lightweight consumer-grade brainwave tracker. These devices detect electrical patterns from the scalp, measuring mental states like attention, meditation, and frustration using frequency bands (alpha, beta, theta, delta, gamma).

            In my earlier work, I had run live EEG tests during user walkthroughs. What I discovered was fascinating‚Äîusers' attention scores dropped sharply during repetitive carousel scrolling and rose only during moments of recognition or peer-based cues (like "Friends Are Watching").

            For the OTT app, we didn't integrate live EEG testing. But the principle influenced our thinking. If we could access such data, we would:
          </p>
          <ul className="cs3-content-list">
            <li>Track micro-hesitation points using momentary drops in attention.</li>
            <li>Tag emotional drift over the course of discovery journeys.</li>
            <li>Build a valence-emotion mapping system (similar to the ValTEx prototype I developed) to personalize flows in real-time.</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="cs3-content-text">Imagine this:</p>
          <ul className="cs3-content-list">
            <li><strong>IF</strong> user's EEG shows rising theta (indecision) for 12+ seconds in one section ‚Üí collapse that section and surface simpler options.</li>
            <li><strong>IF</strong> user maintains beta state (high focus) for multiple genre tiles ‚Üí infer genre curiosity, and expand that category.</li>
            <li><strong>IF</strong> user shows alpha (relaxed but alert) while watching peer-based recommendations ‚Üí raise priority for "Friends Are Watching" feed.</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="cs3-content-text">
            These aren't just science-fiction possibilities. With the rise of affective computing and emotion-aware UX, these techniques are already piloted in advanced usability labs.
          </p>
          <p className="cs3-content-text">
            While we didn't use EEG in the final rollout for the OTT app, I'd strongly advocate for its inclusion in future discovery-driven media platforms, especially when personalization is the battleground.
