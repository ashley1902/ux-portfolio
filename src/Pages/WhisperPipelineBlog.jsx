          <h3>Whisper Series, Part 1: Transcribing UX Interviews with Whisper + ChatGPT‚Äîand Why I Use the Terminal to Get It Done</h3>
          <p>
            As a UX researcher, I‚Äôve spent countless hours listening to user interviews‚Äîscrubbing through audio, annotating key moments, and trying to decipher what users really mean beneath their words. Transcription is a key part of that process. But doing it efficiently? That‚Äôs where tooling makes all the difference.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this post, I‚Äôll share how I use Whisper, ChatGPT, and the Mac Terminal (with Homebrew) to streamline transcription‚Äîand how this combo has become a core part of my UX research workflow.
          </p>

          <h3>Why the Terminal? Isn‚Äôt That Just for Engineers?</h3>
          <p>
            If you‚Äôve never used the Terminal before, I get it. It can feel intimidating. But once you dip your toes in, you‚Äôll find it‚Äôs an incredibly powerful way to control your system, install tools, and build reproducible workflows‚Äîespecially for things like audio transcription.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of it this way: If GUI apps are like using a remote, the Terminal is like programming your own smart home. It‚Äôs direct, flexible, and surprisingly fast once you know a few commands.
          </p>

          <h3>What Is Whisper?</h3>
          <p>
            Whisper is an open-source, automatic speech recognition (ASR) system developed by OpenAI. It‚Äôs trained on a massive amount of multilingual and multitask supervised data collected from the web. It‚Äôs fast, accurate, and‚Äîbest of all‚Äîcan be run locally on your own machine, meaning no internet upload of sensitive research recordings.
          </p>
          <p>
            I mostly use the large-v2 or large-v3 models for the best accuracy, especially when working with noisy data or mixed-accent interviews. It‚Äôs perfect for transcribing:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>UX interviews</li>
            <li>Field recordings</li>
            <li>Customer calls</li>
            <li>Internal product testing sessions</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you‚Äôre running interviews in non-English languages, Whisper supports that too.</p>

          <h3>Step 1: Installing Software with Homebrew</h3>
          <h4>üßÉ What is Homebrew?</h4>
          <p>
            Think of Homebrew as your Mac‚Äôs version of the App Store‚Äîbut in the Terminal. It lets you install everything from media libraries (like FFmpeg) to full applications (like RStudio or VLC) with a single line of code.
          </p>
          <p>To install Homebrew (if you haven‚Äôt already), open your Terminal and run:</p>
          <pre className="code-block">/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"</pre>
          <p>Once that‚Äôs done, you can install almost any package with:</p>
          <pre className="code-block">brew install &lt;package-name&gt;</pre>
          <p>Need a graphical app? Just add <code>--cask</code>:</p>
          <pre className="code-block">brew install --cask vlc</pre>
          <p>For example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>brew install ffmpeg</code> ‚Üí Essential for processing audio files for Whisper.</li>
            <li><code>brew install --cask rstudio</code> ‚Üí If you do stats-heavy research, this is gold.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This method is a lifesaver when your network blocks direct downloads or you‚Äôre working in a restrictive corporate environment.</p>

          <h3>Step 2: Setting Up Whisper</h3>
          <p>Whisper is available in Python and C++ variants. I prefer the C++ version, especially for long interviews, because it‚Äôs faster and more memory-efficient.</p>
          <p>If you‚Äôre using Python, setup is also simple:</p>
          <pre className="code-block">pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git</pre>
          <p>Then run:</p>
          <pre className="code-block">whisper youraudiofile.mp3 --model large-v2</pre>
          <p>It automatically transcribes and outputs a <code>.txt</code> or <code>.srt</code> file, which you can feed into ChatGPT for summarization, theme detection, or insight extraction.</p>

          <h3>Step 3: Why This Changed My Research Workflow</h3>
          <p>Before I adopted this stack, transcription was a frustrating patchwork of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Uploading files to online tools</li>
            <li>Waiting for processing</li>
            <li>Paying per minute of audio</li>
            <li>Manual cleanup of low-accuracy results</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Now, with Whisper and Homebrew installed, I:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Transcribe locally and securely</li>
            <li>Batch process interviews</li>
            <li>Pull transcripts into ChatGPT for deeper analysis (e.g., emotion, themes, quotes)</li>
            <li>Stay inside the Terminal, where I can rename files, edit metadata, or launch next steps‚Äîall without switching windows</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This isn‚Äôt just a speed boost. It‚Äôs workflow empowerment.</p>

          <h3>Pro Tips for Young UXRs</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Learn the Terminal incrementally. You don‚Äôt need to be a developer. Just learn enough to automate your frequent tasks.</li>
            <li>Keep a command cheat sheet. Copy-paste and tweak until it becomes second nature.</li>
            <li>Automate repetitive stuff. Transcribe 10 files in one go? Easy with a loop.</li>
            <li>Pair it with ChatGPT. Ask ChatGPT to summarize the transcript, identify sentiment, or extract common phrases from users. It‚Äôs like having a junior analyst by your side.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Bonus: Book Recommendation</h3>
          <p>
            If you‚Äôre ready to go deeper, check out <em>Tweak Your Mac Terminal</em> by Daniel Jalkut. It‚Äôs friendly, insightful, and full of small tricks that lead to big efficiencies.
          </p>

          <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
          <p>
            Whisper + Homebrew + Terminal + ChatGPT isn‚Äôt just a tech stack‚Äîit‚Äôs a way of thinking. As a UX researcher, the goal isn‚Äôt to just ‚Äúget the transcript‚Äù‚Äîit‚Äôs to mine insight from behavior. These tools help you do that faster, more privately, and more flexibly than traditional services.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Don‚Äôt wait to ‚Äúget technical.‚Äù The Terminal is your friend. Your users‚Äîand your workflow‚Äîwill thank you.</strong></p>
