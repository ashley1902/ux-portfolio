          <p><strong>Why I Stopped Choosing Between CPM-GOMS and Behavioral Science—and Started Using Both</strong></p>
          <h3>The Tale of Rhea and Arjun</h3>
          <p>Let me introduce you to Rhea and Arjun.</p>
          <p>Rhea is a pro. She’s been trading for years. The moment her app buzzes with a market dip alert, she’s already on it—logs in, locates the stock, and hits "sell" without missing a beat.</p>
          <p>Arjun, on the other hand, is relatively new. He gets the same alert. But instead of acting quickly, he hesitates. He opens the app, fumbles around trying to find the right tab, second-guesses himself, and by the time he figures it out, the stock has already bounced back.</p>
          <p>Same app. Same notification. Completely different outcomes.</p>
          <p>What went wrong? More importantly, how do we design for both Rhea and Arjun?</p>
          <p>That question led me down a path I didn’t expect—one that involved not choosing between CPM-GOMS and behavioral science, but weaving them together.</p>

          <h3>The Trouble with Staying in One Lane</h3>
          <p>If you’ve ever run a usability test or tried to diagnose why someone got stuck in a flow, you know how frustrating it can be.</p>
          <p>You have frameworks. You run task analyses. You map out every click, scroll, and tap. You maybe even use CPM-GOMS to model cognitive-perceptual-motor sequences.</p>
          <p>But then a participant says something that throws you off:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>“I just didn’t feel confident.”</li>
            <li>“I got overwhelmed.”</li>
            <li>“I thought the button would do something else.”</li>
          </ul>
          <p>And suddenly, your flowchart doesn’t feel so helpful anymore.</p>
          <p>This is where behavioral science steps in. It explains the why behind the how. It gives us access to motivation, intent, and decision-making under uncertainty. The Fogg Behavior Model, the Theory of Planned Behavior, Kahneman’s work on attention—they all help us understand what’s going on inside the user while they interact.</p>
          <p>But behavioral models alone aren’t enough either. They don’t show us where the friction physically happens on-screen. That’s where task modeling like CPM-GOMS thrives.</p>
          <p>So instead of choosing one, I started combining them. And that changed everything.</p>

          <h3>Stitching the “Why” and the “How” Together</h3>
          <p>Let’s rewind to Rhea.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Motivation?</strong> She wants to avoid loss. Strong.</li>
            <li><strong>Ability?</strong> She's used the app hundreds of times.</li>
            <li><strong>Trigger?</strong> A sharp, urgent push notification during a market dip.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>So she acts. Quickly. Effectively.</p>
          <p>Now look at Arjun.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Motivation?</strong> Same—he’s watching his money slip away.</li>
            <li><strong>Trigger?</strong> Identical notification.</li>
            <li><strong>Ability?</strong> Here’s the problem. He hasn’t used this feature before. He doesn't know where things are.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>So he hesitates. Not because he doesn’t care—but because he can’t act with confidence.</p>
          <p>In behavioral terms (using the Fogg model), no action = low ability.</p>
          <p>Now here’s where CPM-GOMS enters the frame. It lets us map out how users execute tasks step by step:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Tap on the notification</li>
            <li>Launch the app</li>
            <li>Navigate to the stock</li>
            <li>Hit the sell button</li>
            <li>Confirm</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For Rhea, this is a smooth highway. For Arjun, it’s filled with mental potholes. Each tap takes effort. Every label demands interpretation.</p>
          <p>And if we overlay behavioral insights on top of the CPM-GOMS model, something magical happens: we don’t just know where he struggles—we know why he struggles there.</p>

          <h3>Real-World Application: When the Market Dips</h3>
          <p><strong>Scenario:</strong><br/>Notification: “Market dip alert – your stock is down 5%”</p>
          <p><strong>Behavioral Layer (Fogg Behavior Model):</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Motivation:</strong> High (fear of loss)</li>
            <li><strong>Trigger:</strong> Strong (push notification)</li>
            <li><strong>Ability:</strong> Low (poor navigation skill)</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Task Layer (CPM-GOMS):</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Sell the stock</li>
            <li><strong>Operators:</strong> Notification → App → Navigate → Tap Stock → Tap Sell → Confirm</li>
            <li><strong>Bottleneck:</strong> Complex UI layout + unclear navigation labels</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Insight:</strong> The behavioral layer explains the emotional urgency, but the CPM-GOMS model shows us exactly where the app failed Arjun—navigation.</p>

          <h3>Designing with Both Lenses</h3>
          <p>This unified model helped us rethink how we approached product decisions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>During usability testing:</strong> We didn’t just look for broken paths. We asked:
              <ul>
                <li>“What emotion was behind the hesitation?”</li>
                <li>“Was that confusion rooted in design or self-doubt?”</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>In interface design:</strong> We reduced friction by simplifying high-stress actions. A “1-click sell” feature made sense—not just for power users but for those motivated but underconfident.</li>
            <li><strong>With behavioral nudges:</strong> We timed alerts when users were most likely to act and used cues like auto-filled prices and risk-reduction badges to lower hesitation.</li>
            <li><strong>For prioritizing design changes:</strong> We didn’t just automate friction-heavy steps. We made sure those changes matched real user intent—not just speed.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What Happened When We Tried It</h3>
          <p>We applied this blended approach to a test version of a stock trading app. Here’s what stood out:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Behavioral signals (like confidence level) predicted 70% of task initiation variance</li>
            <li>CPM-GOMS mapping found hidden delays in specific UI layers (like confirmation dialogs)</li>
            <li>Using both together? We uncovered 30% more usability issues than with either method alone</li>
            <li>And perhaps most importantly: Users who previously struggled didn’t just complete tasks faster—they felt more confident doing so.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Making the Invisible Visible</h3>
          <p>When we visualize this framework, it looks like a layered lens:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>[User Motivation & Context] → Behavioral Science Layer</li>
            <li>→ [User Tasks & Actions] → CPM-GOMS Layer</li>
            <li>→ [Emotional Feedback Loop]</li>
          </ul>
          <p>No single model holds the full truth. But when layered together, they start telling a deeper story—the one your analytics alone can’t capture.</p>

          <h3>Some Honest Challenges</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>This isn’t a silver bullet.</li>
            <li>It takes time and data. You need both logs and conversations.</li>
            <li>It’s more work to analyze—especially when tasks aren’t linear.</li>
            <li>You need to segment users (novices like Arjun vs experts like Rhea) to get real insight.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>But when it works? It really works.</p>

          <h3>What’s Next?</h3>
          <p>I’ve started applying this method outside of trading apps—into e-commerce, health platforms, even conversational AI agents.</p>
          <p>Imagine:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Nudges that arrive when your user is hesitating</li>
            <li>Design that adapts to user confidence</li>
            <li>AI agents that understand why you’re asking something—not just what you said</li>
          </ul>
          <p>That’s the direction we’re heading.</p>

          <h3>Final Thought</h3>
          <p>For the longest time, I treated CPM-GOMS and behavioral science like tools in separate boxes. One for mapping. One for meaning.</p>
          <p>But now, I see them as layers in the same lens.</p>
          <p>Because design isn’t just about what users do.</p>
          <p><strong>It’s about why they do it.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>And how we can help them succeed—even when they don’t yet know they need it.</strong></p>
