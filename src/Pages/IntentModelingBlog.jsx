          <p>"Every action has an intent behind it—but in AI systems, misreading intent is the fastest way to lose trust."</p>
          <p>Welcome to this blog in our ongoing series exploring the fusion of UX research, behavioral signals, and agentic AI design. In this post, we dive into Intent Modeling—how we can infer, track, and adapt to user intentions using Action Graphs and Drift-Aware Prompts.</p>
          <p>As AI systems move from reactive assistants to adaptive collaborators, understanding why a user does something—beyond what they do—becomes the core of interaction design.</p>
          <p>Let’s explore how to model user intent, handle behavioral ambiguity, and course-correct in real time using UX-informed methods.</p>

          <h3>What Is Intent Modeling?</h3>
          <p>Intent Modeling refers to identifying the underlying goal or purpose behind a user's sequence of actions. It's what powers:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Autocomplete and smart suggestions</li>
            <li>Prompt tailoring in LLM-based agents</li>
            <li>Error recovery or “undo” flows</li>
            <li>Adaptive UI personalization</li>
          </ul>
          <p>But intent is not static. It drifts. It contradicts. And sometimes, it hides in ambiguity.</p>
          <p>That’s where we need structured tools.</p>

          <h3>Action Graphs: Visualizing User Paths and Possibilities</h3>
          <p>An Action Graph is a directed graph of possible user states and actions—designed to map user flows while inferring intent over time.</p>
          <pre>{`[Search Flight] --> [Compare Prices] --> [Select Flight] --> [Book Flight]
   |                         |                  |
[Explore Destinations]   [Check Reviews]   [Save for Later]`}</pre>
          <p>Each node = an observed or inferred intent<br />
             Each edge = an action or decision<br />
             Each path = a unique intent trajectory</p>

          <h3>From Actions to Intents: Bayesian Inference</h3>
          <p>We use probabilistic models to infer the most likely intent based on observed sequences.</p>
          <p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
          User path: Home → Destination Guide → Travel Tips → Visa Info<br />
          System infers:<br />
          P(Intent="PlanInternationalTrip"∣Actions) &gt; 0.9</p>
          <p>Using Bayesian updating:</p>
          <pre>{`P(Intent_i | A) = [P(A | Intent_i) * P(Intent_i)] / Σ[P(A | Intent_j) * P(Intent_j)]`}</pre>

          <h3>What Happens When Drift Breaks the Model?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>They abandon flows</li>
            <li>They change goals midway</li>
            <li>They act randomly due to exploration or fatigue</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Enter: Drift-Aware Prompts</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>User actions deviate from modeled intent</li>
            <li>Confidence in intent inference drops below a threshold</li>
            <li>Emotional signals (from ValTEx) indicate friction or confusion</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Prompt Types Based on Drift Classification</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Goal Ambiguity:</strong> "Are you looking to book a trip or just exploring options?"</li>
            <li><strong>Error-Induced Drift:</strong> "It looks like something went wrong. Would you like help booking manually?"</li>
            <li><strong>Exploratory Drift:</strong> "Want to save this search for later comparison?"</li>
            <li><strong>Emotional Drift (Negative Valence):</strong> "Not finding what you need? Try refining your filters."</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Closing the Loop: Intent Feedback Integration</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Did the user follow through?</li>
            <li>Did they abandon the flow again?</li>
            <li>Did sentiment improve?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This creates a feedback loop that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Refines the intent model (Bayesian update or LSTM)</li>
            <li>Adjusts future prompts (dynamic re-ranking)</li>
            <li>Informs UX design (identify broken or ambiguous paths)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Case Study: AI Resume Coach</h3>
          <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> AI helps users craft resumes using LLMs.<br />
          <strong>Observed Sequence:</strong> Upload CV → Add Skills → Delete Work History → Add Custom Section → Stop<br />
          <strong>System Confusion:</strong> Is user rebuilding resume from scratch? Correcting an error? Abandoning?<br />
          <strong>Drift-Aware Prompt Triggered:</strong> “Looks like you're customizing your resume heavily—would you like a fresh template instead?”<br />
          <strong>Outcome:</strong><br />
          - User selected “Yes”<br />
          - Engagement continued with higher ValTEx score (positive valence increase)<br />
          - Task completion time decreased by 30%</p>

          <h3>Design Principles for Intent-Aware AI Interfaces</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Model from context, not just clicks</li>
            <li>Design fallbacks, not dead ends</li>
            <li>Respect ambiguity</li>
            <li>Link with loop telemetry</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>The UX Superpower: Combining Intention + Emotion + Action</h3>
          <p>Imagine this flow:</p>
          <p>User skips profile setup → System infers low intent → Sentiment goes negative (ValTEx) → Drift increases → Prompt appears → User accepts → Task completes → Valence rises → Loop feedback improves</p>
          <p>This is not just “smart UI”—this is cognitive-responsive design.</p>

          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Action Graphs model flow</li>
            <li>Bayesian inference estimates user intent</li>
            <li>Drift-Aware Prompts correct course</li>
            <li>Feedback loops validate and refine</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Together, they power a resilient, user-aware AI experience—one that adapts to human variation without losing track of goals.</strong></p>
