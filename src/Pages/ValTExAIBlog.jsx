          <h2>Introduction: Why We Need a Metric Like ValTEx</h2>
          <p>
            As AI agents become central to everyday interaction—copilots, assistants, content generators—we face a fundamental design challenge:
            How do we know when users are drifting emotionally or semantically away from what the agent is doing?
          </p>
          <p>
            In other words: How can we measure trust loss before it becomes visible as churn?
          </p>
          <p>
            Existing methods capture isolated signals:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sentiment analysis reveals affective tone</li>
            <li>Semantic similarity catches misunderstanding</li>
            <li>Telemetry tracks behaviors like retries or long pauses</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            But few frameworks combine these signals into a single, human-readable, designer-friendly metric that reflects user-agent alignment in real time.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's where ValTEx (Valence-Telemetry Exchange Score) comes in.
          </p>
          <p>
            ValTEx is a composite UX metric that models emotional trust dynamics between a user and an AI system. It can power early-warning systems, rerouting logic, adaptive prompts, or even serve as a real-time dashboard KPI for UX researchers and AI PMs.
          </p>

          <h3>How ValTEx Works: The Formula and Its Intuition</h3>
          <pre>{`ValTEx = λ₁ ⋅ S + λ₂ ⋅ (1 - D) + λ₃ ⋅ T`}</pre>
          <p>Where:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>S</strong> = Sentiment Similarity Score: How well the agent's response emotionally matches the user's affective intent.</li>
            <li><strong>D</strong> = Semantic Drift Score: The distance between user intent and agent response (higher drift = more misalignment).</li>
            <li><strong>T</strong> = Telemetry Score: Time-on-task, retries, rephrases, and undo behavior.</li>
            <li><strong>λ₁, λ₂, λ₃</strong> = Weights (default: 0.4, 0.4, 0.2)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Each signal is normalized to fall between 0 and 1.
          </p>
          <p>
            The 1-D inversion rewards semantic closeness. High D means drift; 1-D means cohesion.
          </p>
          <p>
            The higher the ValTEx score, the stronger the emotional and cognitive alignment between user and agent.
          </p>

          <h3>How Is This Different from Other Valence Systems?</h3>
          <p>
            The HEC Montréal UX Data course demonstrates how to track emotional valence while a user watches a movie or interacts passively with a product. That work is important—it brings emotion into UX.
          </p>
          <p>
            But ValTEx is different in four key ways:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Interaction-Centric, Not Experience-Centric</strong><br />
              ValTEx is tuned for agentic AI interactions—chatbots, copilots, task assistants. It tracks emotion during two-way dialogue, not just one-way media or chair-sitting.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Composite Metric, Not Just Emotion</strong><br />
              Most valence tools only measure emotion. ValTEx integrates emotion + semantics + behavior to give a fuller picture.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Actionable by Design</strong><br />
              ValTEx is not just descriptive. It’s built to power: Loop recovery triggers, Conversational pivoting, Adaptive prompt design, Trust calibration UX
            </li>
            <li><strong>Interpretable at Runtime</strong><br />
              Unlike deep model trust scores, ValTEx can be read and explained by a human:
              “This user’s sentiment is aligned, but their semantic drift is high, and telemetry shows retries—ValTEx is low."
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Building ValTEx from the Ground Up</h3>
          <h4>Sentiment Similarity (S)</h4>
          <p>
            Computed as cosine similarity between a user's emotional intent and the agent’s response tone. Values closer to 1 = emotionally aligned. E.g., user shows frustration, and the agent mirrors empathy = high score.
          </p>
          <h4>Semantic Drift (D)</h4>
          <p>
            Cosine distance between user query vector and agent response vector. High D = poor understanding. We invert it to (1 - D) in the formula to reflect alignment, not drift.
          </p>
          <h4>Telemetry Score (T)</h4>
          <p>
            A weighted average of: Time-on-task (normalized), Undo/retry frequency, Prompt reformulations. Captures behavioral hesitation or friction.
          </p>
          <h4>Weights (λ₁, λ₂, λ₃)</h4>
          <p>
            Default: 0.4, 0.4, 0.2. Drift is weighted heavily because semantic misalignment predicts trust loss most strongly.
          </p>

          <h3>Experimental Results</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Sample: 100 simulated agentic sessions</li>
            <li>Distribution:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>S ~ N(0.7, 0.1)</li>
              <li>D ~ N(0.5, 0.15)</li>
              <li>T ~ N(0.75, 0.1)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Trust was modeled as: Trust = 5 ⋅ ValTEx + ε, ε ~ N(0, 0.2)</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Regression Findings:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Sentiment Similarity: 1.64</li>
            <li>Inverted Drift: 2.05</li>
            <li>Telemetry Score: 1.06</li>
            <li>Intercept: 0.23</li>
            <li>R² Score: 0.824</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Semantic misalignment had the strongest effect on trust.</strong></p>

          <h3>Use Cases in UX Research and Product Design</h3>
          <p>
            Before diving into use cases, let's touch on a practical question researchers often face:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            Can we actually use the emotional recovery formula R(t) = a(1 – e^(–bt)) in real-world UX studies, where data is discrete and sampled over interaction turns rather than continuously?
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Yes, we can—by treating it as a fitted curve. Even if we only capture emotional data at a few steps (e.g., after message 1, 2, 3…), we can still fit this exponential recovery model using nonlinear regression.
          </p>
          <p>Here's how:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Collect ValTEx or sentiment scores across multiple interaction steps.</li>
            <li>Use a fitting method (e.g., scipy.optimize.curve_fit) to estimate best-fit values for a (max recovery) and b (recovery rate).</li>
            <li>Interpret the shape of the curve to understand how quickly and fully users recover from AI friction.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Gives a mathematical structure to emotional healing in AI interaction.</li>
            <li>Supports predictive modeling: who will recover, who won't.</li>
            <li>Validates your agent’s recovery design (e.g., re-prompts, empathy injection).</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Graph</h4>
          <p><em>Image 1</em></p>
          <img src="/valtex-ai-diagram.png" alt="ValTEx Diagram" className="blog-image" />
          <p><em>Red dots: Discrete ValTEx points collected at interaction steps.</em></p>
          <p><em>Blue curve: Best-fit exponential recovery model using R(t) = a(1 – e^(–bt))</em></p>
          <p>This transforms ValTEx from a snapshot into a time-aware recovery model.</p>

          <h3>Now, let’s explore how ValTEx applies to specific UX research and product contexts:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>AI Copilots & Chat Interfaces: Use ValTEx to detect drop-offs, misunderstandings, or misaligned tone.</li>
            <li>Loop Break Detection: When ValTEx &lt; 0.55, prompt the agent to reframe or clarify.</li>
            <li>UX Dashboards: Use ValTEx as a real-time trust proxy.</li>
            <li>A/B Testing: Compare ValTEx trajectories across prompt versions.</li>
            <li>Forecast Drift: Use ValTEx time series to predict user disengagement before it happens</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>How It Works with Human-Led Research</h3>
          <p>
            ValTEx doesn’t replace your intuition. It augments it.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A low score tells you where to look.</li>
            <li>A time series curve tells you when it broke.</li>
            <li>A regression tells you which variable is causing it.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It's the first pass, not the final judgment.
          </p>

          <h3>Future Directions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Live implementation in LLM agent systems</li>
            <li>Combining ValTEx with emotion generation (not just detection)</li>
            <li>Plug-in compatibility with GPT API, Claude, Gemini, etc.</li>
            <li>Human-in-the-loop annotation of emotional triggers</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Closing Thought</h3>
          <p>
            ValTEx is not just a formula. It’s a lens. It helps us see user trust and emotion not as flat metrics, but as unfolding, dynamic signals.
          </p>
          <p>
            As AI agents take on more roles in people’s lives, we must design for empathy, recovery, and emotional intelligence.
          </p>
          <p><strong>ValTEx is one way to do that.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Let’s bring the human back into human-AI interaction.</strong></p>
